The .jar is located at

target/decision-tree-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

The code can be recompiled using Maven:
(in this directory)
$ mvn package

The .jar takes a single argument: the input ARFF file.
The type of decision tree and/or the entropy threshold need to be modified by hand (in the Trainer class.) This really should have been handled at the command line. I apologize for this oversight.

Issues:
- The randomized tree tends to be trivial for binary problems with unbalanced classes. This is the intended behavior, though.
- Inconsistent data (where all predictive attributes are the same, but the class labels differ) is not handled well. Try running the entropy tree on solar.flare2.arff with a threshold below 0.3. I thought I fixed this, but apparently not.
- Assorted other things (redundant class fields, etc.) that arose because I don't know how to design a program of this size in a halfway decent way.

Things left undone:
- Splitting criteria for numeric values are implemented in the IntervalCriterion class, but I didn't have time to implement entropy minimization for such criteria.
